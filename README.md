A Llama Stack backed app to facilitate abstract generation for academic research papers. Trained the llama-3-8b-bnb-4bit (8 billion parameters) model using the LoRA fine-tuning technique on a Kaggle paper abstract dataset. Designed a Streamlit front-end that interfaced with a Fast API backend with Llama Stack orchestration. Built for the 8VC x Meta x HackDuke CodeFest.
